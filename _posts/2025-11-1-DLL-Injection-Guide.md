# DLL Injection: A Comprehensive Security Perspective

I created this short paper to sumerize my knowledge about DLL and DLL Injection in one place. Its much easier to exploit something from time to time when you don't have to remind every detail again and agian :). There is no fancy stuff, the idea was to create general guide to help myself when I came across DLL Injection in the future. 

## 1. What is a DLL?

As we can read on [oficial microsoft page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/setup-upgrade-and-drivers/dynamic-link-library#more-information) - "a DLL is a library that contains code and data that can be used by more than one program at the same time". It's more eficient to place your code in DLL when you know it will be used in multiple places. Unlike static libraries that are embedded into an executable at compile time, DLL will be loaded when particular function is called inside the code.

Applications can be devided into multiple modules, each module have its seperate DLL file, which is loaded seperatly when main application (.exe file) requires it. It is more eficient for system to maintain mudular application, but I think more important is fact, that is also easier to maintain applications code when its devided into modules.

### 1.2 Structure and Portable Executable (PE) Format

Structure of Portable Executable (PE) is quite complicated and I am not going to copy the inforamtion from oficial microsoft website, you can find [more information there](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format). 
Great visualization was done in the picture below, where simple.exe was described, however the structure is similar to the DLL file

Understading of how the PE format is build and works is whole other topic. 0xRick on his blog explained in details how PE format is stucture so you can find more information there - [Dive into PE Format](https://0xrick.github.io/win-internals/pe1/)

## 2. Detection Mechanisms: Procmon and Process Explorer

First, we will need an example of the application that does not work as standalone application and loads aditional modules - DLL binaries. For that purpose we will use simple service (run with the highest privileges - NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM). It is a PoC service, so the only importat thing it does, it tries to load DLL using `LoadLibraryA" every 5 seconds.
```C
while (true) {
    HMODULE hModule = LoadLibraryA("vulnerable.dll");

    Sleep(5000);
}
```
In `LoadLibraryA` path to DLL is not provided, just name of the DLL, so the application will search in the current directory. Another way to specify targeted DLL is to specify the whole path, e.g. `C:\Temp\vulnerable.dll`. How is it done depends on the application.

When the program was compiled successfuly, it was added as new service:
![new service](../_screenshots/service-create.png)

### 2.1 Process Monitor (Procmon)

**Process Monitor (Procmon)** is a real-time Windows system monitoring tool from Sysinternals that captures system calls, registry operations, and file I/O operations.

**Detecting Missing DLLs**:
Procmon captures all events that happens on the system, which can be overlaming at first, when we first time open the program. That is why there is a function for filtering events, to reduce the number of displayed rows.  As an example, we will inwestigate service that is running with SYSTEM privileges. 

Moving on into the ProcMon itself, when first time open up, it starts printing thounsds of events every second. To lower that number we can use filters and only target the binary (Process Name) we want to see. 

![filters](../_screenshots/procmon1.1.png)

As you can see I already added one more filter, it cuts the results to only those "NAME NOT FOUND", which means that it will display rows where file was not found in the selected directory.

### Search order

In the source code only name of DLL was specified and application, because of that, system will try to find the binary in multiple places. Search order differs if the "Safe DLL Search Mode" is enabled or not, but it is by default enabled on modern systems so its really rarly to find system with this switch turnd off. The search orderd goes as follows:

1. Application's Directory
The folder where the executable (vuln-service.exe) is located - in this case C:\Temp.

2. System Directory 
C:\Windows\System32

3. 16-bit System Directory 
C:\Windows\System

4. Windows Directory C:\Windows
Use GetWindowsDirectory to find this.

5. Current Working Directory
The process's current directory (which might be different from the app directory).

6. PATH Environment Variable
All directories listed in the system's %PATH% variable, searched in the order they appear.

![search order](../_screenshots/search4.png)

The search stops imiditly, when application finds the desired DLL. Looking at the list above, most often normal user will not have write permissions on both System Directories, nor C:\Windows, so the best shot is Application's Directory, Current Working Directory if it is different then others and PATH. 
In this example, the service was created in the C:\Windows\System32 directory, so the Current Working Directory is set to that value. 

### Path

Every user on a Windows operating system has their own **PATH** environment variable. It combines the user-specific PATH and the system-wide PATH. The user PATH can be edited by the user themselves, while editing the system PATH requires administrative privileges because system variables apply to all users on the machine.

Using PATH, a user can easily run programs without typing their full paths. For example, instead of entering  
`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`, the user can simply type `powershell` in the console.

The system-wide PATH is stored in the registry under:  
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment`  

The per-user PATH is stored under:  
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment` for each specific user.


> **NOTE:** There is one more important place on the system - `Computer\HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Environment` in the Registry. It stores environment variables for the default system session used by the Winlogon process (login screen), processes running before user logon, and services executing as LocalSystem (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM). Important note - it is NOT a template for new users, NOT inherited by new user profiles for PATH, and does NOT affect existing users.

New user profiles are initialized from the **Default User** profile (`C:\Users\Default`), whose registry hive is loaded when the account is created, and then combined with the system PATH.

**The effective PATH for a given user consists of:**

- System PATH from `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment`
- User PATH from `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment`

These two parts are merged by Windows to form the complete PATH for that user's session.

### 2.2 Process Explorer

**Process Explorer**, another Sysinternals tool, provides a hierarchical view of running processes with detailed information about loaded DLLs and open files. Process Explorer does not provide information about every try of loading DLL binary and because of this we will stick to the **Process monitor**

## 3. Custom DLL
Before we dive into execution of DLL Injection itself, we will need our malicious DLL, which will be executed during the attack. There are many different aproches on to how to generate that DLL, but for now we will stick to the most basic one. 
Open Visual Studio and create new DLL project

## 4. DLL Injection: Mechanism and Execution

### 4.1 Definition

So far we have general knowledge about what DLL file is, we know how to monitor loaded DLL using Process Monitor and we have prepared our target application - in this case simple service which tries to load DLL file every 5 seconds. Now we can move to the DLL Injection itself, how it works and how to take advantege of it. 

**DLL Injection** is a technique used to introduce a Dynamic Link Library into the address space of a running process, thereby altering the behavior of that process without modifying its original code. The injected DLL executes with the same privileges as the target process and can perform arbitrary operations within that context.

### 4.2 DLL Injection - Attack description

The DLL injection process follows a systematic approach:

1. **Process Identification**: Using Process Monitor identify which process you want to target. In this case we already have choseen service - `vuln-service.exe` but during regular audit, you want to take your time during that phase. More info about this in #TODO

2. **Process loads DLL**: Wiemy w jaką aplikacje chcemy celować, więc w ProcMon zawężamy scope tylko do tego procesu i patrzymy z jakich ścieżek próbuje łądować DLL.
![DLL from vulnerable service](../_screenshots/procmon2.png)

Chcemy targtować tylko pliki DLL, dlatego w filtrach można zawęzić wyświetlanie rekordów tylko do tych, gdzie Path kończy sie na ".dll". 
![Only DLLs](../_screenshots/procmon3.png)


3. **Path identification**: Jako zwykli użytkownicy nie mamy zapisu w ścieżkach jak `C:\Windows\*` czy `C:\Program Files\*`, zakładając oczywiście, że nikt na systemie nie edytował domyślnych ustawień. Dlatego z powyższych rekordów najwięcej nadzieje daje ten `C:\Temp`, który nie istnieje domyślnie na systemie, dlatego daje nadzieje na podatną konfiguracje.

![C:\Temp permissions](../_screenshots/permissions.png)

Każdy zalogowany członek systemu jest w grupie Authenticated Users, oznacza to że jako nisko uprzywilijowany użytkownik mamy możliwość zapisu w podanej ścieżce.

![Authenticated Users Group confirmation](../_screenshots/permissions2.png)

Na tym etapie wiemy już że podatność występuje, mamy potwierdzenie że wysoko uprziwilejowany process próbuje ładować plik DLL ze ścieżki nad którą niskouprziwlejowany użytkownik ma kontrolę. Teraz potrzebujemy tylko przygotować PoC eskalacji uprawnień, to znaczy stworzyć złośliwy plik DLL i wstawić go w odpowiednie miejsce.

4. **Custom DLL compilation**: #TODO

4. **DLL Path Injection**: 

4. **Execution**: A remote thread is created within the target process using `CreateRemoteThread()`, instructing it to load the DLL via `LoadLibrary()` or similar functions.

## 5. DLL Sideloading: The Stealthy Injection Vector

### 5.1 Definition and Mechanism

**DLL Sideloading**, also known as **DLL search-order hijacking**, is a technique where an attacker places a malicious DLL in the same directory as a legitimate, signed executable. When the executable launches, Windows searches for required DLLs following a specific search order:

1. The directory from which the application was loaded (first priority)
2. The system directory
3. The Windows directory
4. The directories in the PATH environment variable

By exploiting this search order, the attacker's malicious DLL is found and loaded instead of the legitimate system DLL.

### 5.2 Why DLL Sideloading is Effective

**Evasion advantages**:
- The process tree shows execution of a legitimate, signed binary (not malware)
- The parent process is often trusted
- Signed binaries face less scrutiny from security solutions
- No registry modifications or suspicious process creation
- Appears as normal application behavior

**Real-world example**: An attacker copies both a legitimate `explorer.exe` and a malicious `shell32.dll` to a user-writable directory. When the user executes the legitimate binary from that location, it loads the malicious DLL first, executing the attacker's payload while the legitimate application either crashes or continues normally (depending on implementation).


---

## 6. DLL Proxying: Advanced Stealthy Evasion

### 6.1 Definition

**DLL Proxying** is an advanced technique combining DLL sideloading with **export forwarding**. Instead of simply loading a malicious DLL, the proxy DLL forwards all exported function calls to the legitimate original DLL while executing a malicious payload. This ensures the target application functions normally, avoiding crashes or suspicious behavior.

### 6.2 How DLL Proxying Works

The process involves creating a wrapper DLL that:
1. Exports all the same functions as the original DLL
2. Forwards function calls to the legitimate DLL
3. Executes malicious code in its `DllMain` entry point

**Export Forwarding Mechanism**: Instead of containing actual function implementations, the Export Address Table contains forwarders—strings that redirect to functions in another DLL. For example:

```
EXPORTS
    GetFileVersionInfoA = SHCore.dll.GetFileVersionInfoA
    GetFileVersionInfoW = SHCore.dll.GetFileVersionInfoW
    CommandLineToArgvW = SHCore.dll.CommandLineToArgvW
```

When an application calls `GetFileVersionInfoA`, the Windows loader automatically redirects the call to `SHCore.dll.GetFileVersionInfoA`.

### 6.3 Why DLL Proxying is Necessary

**Without Proxying**:
- Target application expects specific function exports
- If the malicious DLL doesn't provide these functions, the application crashes
- Crash is suspicious and easily detected
- Attacker's presence becomes obvious

**With Proxying**:
- All expected functions are available (forwarded to legitimate DLL)
- Application functions normally
- Malicious payload executes silently in the background
- Behavior appears completely legitimate to users and security tools

**Historical precedent**: The infamous Stuxnet malware used DLL proxying extensively to maintain stealth while executing its mission.

## 11. Recon, how to identify processes,services, binaries to perform DLL injection
Zwykle DLL są ładowane podczas startu programu i później podczas wykonywaniu konkretnej akcji, dlatego wymagane jest pewne zrozumienie działania danego programu aby go poprawnie sprawdzić. W przypadku samych serwisów, na pewno łatwiej na początku jest zidentyfikować customowe serwisy, ich ścieżki i od nich dalej próbować zrozumieć dany program. Zaczynanie od Process monitora nie jest zawsze najlepszym rozwiązaniem.
